# TDD + Acessibility == easy && !hard

This repo supports a conference talk by [Maia Miller](https://www.alephaccessibility.net/) & [Chris Simon](https://chrissimon.au/) demonstrating the use of Test-Driven Development with a focus on using the Accessibility APIs to build websites.

The repository includes a commit for each step in the TDD Red->Green->Refactor cycle so you can follow the journey/evolution of the codebase.

The best way to follow along is to checkout the first first commit which is tagged with `start` and then use the `forwards.sh` and `backwards.sh` to move forwards and backwards through the git history and watch the codebase evolve:

`git checkout start`

then:

`forwards.sh`

And browse around in your IDE of choice.
